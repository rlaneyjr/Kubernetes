          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
          secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
          save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
          the hub container. A value set here will make JupyterHub overwrite any previous file.

          You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
          storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
          default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
          value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
          restarts.

          Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
          *immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised

            description: |
              Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

              The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
              where it should be stored.

              The various options are:

              1. **sqlite-pvc**

                 Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

                 By default, this disk is created by the cloud provider using
                 *dynamic provisioning* configured by a [storage
                 class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
                 You can customize how this disk is created / attached by
                 setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

                 This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
                 deployments.

              2. **sqlite-memory**

                 Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
                 since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
                 to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

                 When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
                 hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
                 Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

              3. **mysql**

                 Use an externally hosted mysql database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

                 Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

              4. **postgres**

                 Use an externally hosted postgres database.

                 You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
                 want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

                 The general format of the connection string is:
                 ```
                 postgres+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
                 ```

                 The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
                 tables in the database specified.

                 Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

      extraEnv:
        type: list
        description: |
          Extra environment variables that should be set for the hub pod.

          A list of [EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.9/#envvar-v1-core)
          objects.

          These are usually used in two circumstances:
            - Passing parameters to some custom code specified with `extraConfig`
            - Passing parameters to an authenticator or spawner that can be directly customized
              by environment variables (rarer)
      extraConfig:
        type: string
        description: |
          Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

          This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
          that is not present here as an option, you can just write the raw Python to do it here.

          Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
            - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
            - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
            - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
            - Anything else you can think of!

          Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
          [| operator](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

          For example:
            ```yaml
            hub:
              extraConfig: |
                c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
                c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'
            ```

          No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
          manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
          some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!
      uid:
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        description:
          The UID the hub process should be running as.

          Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a user with this uid
          exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!

          Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the
          default hub image.
      fsGid:
        type: integer
        minimum: 0
        description:
          The gid the hub process should be using when touching any volumes mounted.

          Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a group with this gid
          exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!

          Defaults to 1000, which is the gid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the
          default hub image.
  proxy:

    properties:
      secretToken:

        description: |
          A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
          between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

          ```sh
          # to generate a value, run
          openssl rand -hex 32
          ```

          Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
          practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
          it to something else, or user data can be compromised
    required:
      - secretToken

          cryptoKey:
            type:
              - string
              - "null"
            description: |
              auth_state will be encrypted and stored in the Hub’s database. This can include things like authentication tokens, etc. to be passed to Spawners as environment variables.
              Encrypting auth_state requires the cryptography package.
              It must contain one (or more, separated by ;) 32-byte encryption keys. These can be either base64 or hex-encoded.
              The JUPYTERHUB_CRYPT_KEY environment variable for the hub pod is set using this entry.

              ```sh
              # to generate a value, run
              openssl rand -hex 32
              ```

              If encryption is unavailable, auth_state cannot be persisted.

      userPlaceholder:
        type: object
        description: |
          User placeholders simulate users but will thanks to PodPriority be
          evicted by the cluster autoscaler if a real user shows up. In this way
          placeholders allow you to create a headroom for the real users and
          reduce the risk of a user having to wait for a node to be added. Be
          sure to use the the continuous image puller as well along with
          placeholders, so the images are also available when real users arrive.

          To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
          placeholders with the following command:
          ```sh
          # Configure to have 3 user placeholders
          kubectl scale sts/user-placeholder --replicas=3
          ```

          enabled:
            type: bool

            type: object
            description: |
              Unless specified here, the placeholder pods will request the same
              resources specified for the real singleuser pods.
      userDummy:
        type: object
        description: |
          User dummies can help you ensure your cluster autoscaler,
          user-scheduler and pod priority is setup to your liking. User
          dummies behave like placeholders but they have their pod priority
          setup like real users and can evict placeholders.

          To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
          dummies with the following command.

          ```sh
          # Configure to have 3 user dummies
          kubectl scale sts/user-dummy --replicas=3
          ```

              How many user-dummy pods would you like to have? Note that it
              makes more sense to have this set at 0 but then adjust it with a
              kubectl scale command during testing.

            description: |
              When a pod is to be scheduled, the scheduled can be made to prefer
              of require having other pods within the same domain (commonly the
              same
              node).
            properties:
              preferScheduleNextToRealUsers:
                type: bool
                description: |
                  Consider two nodes, one with two user-placeholder pods and one
                  with two actual users. With this preconfigured affinity option
                  set, the pod will schedule next to the real users which is
                  what you would want in order to accomplish efficient cluster
                  autoscaling.

                  NOTE: This is recommended for clusters with less than 100
                  nodes, but since pod affinities are computationally expensive
                  and cause the scheduler to leave new pods in Pending state for
                  seconds upwards if the cluster grows large.
